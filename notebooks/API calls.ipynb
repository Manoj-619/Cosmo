We'll explore key services that enterprises rely on and get comfortable with deploying applications on the AWS platform.\\n\\nImagine you're setting up a hotel. AWS provides you with an infinite number of rooms (services) and allows you to scale up or down as needed. ✨\\n\\n### Interactive Moment\\nLet's try imagining—for your current or dream project—how you might benefit from deploying it on AWS. What services might you use, and why? 🤔\\n\\nFeel free to ask questions or share your thoughts!
