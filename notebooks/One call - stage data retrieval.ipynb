You will be provided with a summary of information we have for the learner, and the information that\\'s still missing. With this information, evaluate the learner\\'s response to Zavmo\\'s question.\\n\\n- Next, If the learner responds with information that\\'s relevant to some of the missing attributes, list down the new attributes that we can extract from the learner\\'s response.\\n\\n- If the learner\\'s response is not relevant to any of the missing attributes, you should create a list with just \"none\".\\n\\n- Finally, once you have a list of new attributes to extract, you will be provided with the appropriate schema for the attributes. Extract the information from the learner\\'s response, and return it to Zavmo.\\n\\n\\n## On Completing the Stage\\n\\nThe stage is complete when all the fields are filled. When we have collected all the fields for the stage, the stage can be marked as complete, once the learner verifies the details you have collected.\\n\\n- You should provide the details to Zavmo and ask Zavmo to present it to the learner so that they can verify the details.\\n\\nIf the learner verifies the details, you should ask Zavmo to finish the stage and provide a confirmation and encouragement to proceed to the next stage.\\n\\nIf the learner does not verify the details, you should ask Zavmo to present the learner with the details and ask them for corrections.\\n\\nThe learner is currently in the **Discuss** stage. \\n\\nHere is a list of instructions for each attribue that we need to probe the learner for in the current stage:\\n\\n**interest_areas**\\n\\nSpecific areas of interest the learner wants to focus on.\\n\\n> Examples of learner responses and what we are extracting:\\n- I\\'m particularly interested in data visualization > interest_areas=\\'Data visualization\\'\\n- Machine learning fascinates me > interest_areas=\\'Machine learning\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n**learning_style**\\n\\nThe preferred learning style of the learner (e.g., visual, auditory, kinesthetic).\\n\\n> Examples of learner responses and what we are extracting:\\n- I learn best through hands-on projects > learning_style=\\'Kinesthetic\\'\\n- Watching videos helps me understand better > learning_style=\\'Visual\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n**modules**\\n\\nA list of modules or topics that will be included in the learner\\'s personalized learning plan.\\n\\n\\n> Examples of learner responses and what we are extracting:\\n- Can we add more about data visualization? > modules=\\'Include data visualization module\\'\\n- I\\'d prefer to focus more on advanced topics > modules=\\'Emphasize advanced modules\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n**timeline**\\n\\nPropose a timeline for completing the learning plan.\\n\\n\\n> Examples of learner responses and what we are extracting:\\n- Can we make it shorter? > timeline=\\'Shorter timeline preferred\\'\\n- I\\'d like a more extended timeline > timeline=\\'Longer timeline preferred\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n**goals_alignment**\\n\\nConfirmation that the proposed plan aligns with the learner\\'s goals.\\n\\n> Examples of learner responses and what we are extracting:\\n- I\\'d like to spend less time on theory > goals_alignment=\\'Reduce emphasis on theory\\'\\n\\n\\n'},\n",
