Based on the provided OFQUAL unit text, generate a structured and detailed Marking Scheme explicitly aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy, using the provided schema:

### Required Output Structure:
- **Bloom's Taxonomy Level**: Clearly indicate one of the following levelsâ€”Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create.
- **Criteria**: Clearly defined and appropriately challenging criteria specific to each Bloom's level, directly aligned with the provided OFQUAL unit.
- **Expectations**: Detailed descriptions of what learners must demonstrate to fulfill the criteria for each taxonomy level.
- **Task**: A clearly defined, specific, and measurable task designed around each Bloom's level, reflecting the OFQUAL unit content and the criteria set.
- **Benchmarking Responses**: Provide four exemplar responses per task, each matching one of the following grading scales, clearly illustrating OFQUAL standards:
  - **Fail (39% or below)**: Demonstrates minimal understanding or incomplete effort.
  - **Pass (40%-59%)**: Shows basic understanding but lacks depth or detailed application.
  - **Merit (60%-79%)**: Indicates solid understanding, detailed application, and relevant insight.
  - **Distinction (80%-100%)**: Exemplifies outstanding depth of understanding, creativity, insight, and sophisticated knowledge application.

### Important Guidelines:
- Strictly adhere to the provided schema (`MarkSchemeItem` and `GradingScale` models).
- Clearly differentiate tasks across Bloom's Taxonomy levels using appropriate verbs (e.g., "list," "explain," "demonstrate," "compare," "evaluate," "design").
- Ensure consistency, comprehensiveness, and direct alignment with the provided OFQUAL unit content.
- Verify completeness by including all six Bloom's Taxonomy levels, each with precisely four benchmarking responses.
