# AI-Driven Training Needs Analysis System Architecture & Process Flow

## 1. Initial Job Description Analysis

### Data Input Processing
- Accept JD upload in various formats (PDF, DOC, TXT)
- Convert to standardized text format
- Extract key information:
  * Job title and level
  * Key responsibilities
  * Required competencies
  * Technical skills
  * Behavioral requirements

### Text Processing Steps
1. Apply NLP preprocessing:
   - Tokenization
   - Lemmatization
   - Stop word removal
   - Named entity recognition for job-specific terms
2. Create vector embeddings of JD content
3. Extract key themes and competency areas

## 2. NOS Matching Process

### Primary Matching Algorithm
1. Vector Similarity Comparison
   - Convert NOS standards to vectors
   - Compare JD vectors with NOS vectors
   - Calculate similarity scores
   - Rank matches by relevance

2. Level Determination
   - Analyze complexity of responsibilities
   - Map against NOS level descriptors
   - Consider:
     * Decision-making scope
     * Leadership requirements
     * Technical complexity
     * Strategic involvement

### Validation Checks
- Cross-reference multiple NOS units
- Check for interdependencies
- Verify level alignment
- Confirm coverage of all key JD areas

## 3. TNA Question Generation

### Question Framework Development
1. Map NOS Requirements to Bloom's Levels:
   - Remember: Basic knowledge questions
   - Understand: Comprehension questions
   - Apply: Practical application questions
   - Analyze: Problem-solving questions
   - Evaluate: Assessment questions
   - Create: Innovation questions

2. Create Question Types Matrix:
   ```
   Knowledge Questions:
   - Technical understanding
   - Process knowledge
   - Regulatory awareness

   Behavioral Questions:
   - Application of skills
   - Decision-making approach
   - Problem-solving methods

   Attitude Questions:
   - Professional outlook
   - Learning orientation
   - Change adaptability
   ```

### Question Generation Rules
1. For Each NOS Component:
   - Generate 2-3 knowledge questions
   - Generate 2-3 behavioral questions
   - Generate 1-2 attitude questions
   
2. Apply Difficulty Scaling:
   - Level 4: 60% operational, 40% strategic
   - Level 5: 50% operational, 50% strategic
   - Level 6: 40% operational, 60% strategic
   - Level 7: 30% operational, 70% strategic

3. Question Format Distribution:
   - 40% Likert scale questions
   - 30% Multiple choice
   - 20% Open-ended
   - 10% Scenario-based

## 4. Response Analysis Framework

### Quantitative Analysis
1. Score Calculation:
   - Weight questions by importance
   - Normalize scores across categories
   - Calculate competency gaps

2. Proficiency Mapping:
   - Map responses to NOS requirements
   - Calculate current vs required levels
   - Generate gap analysis

### Qualitative Analysis
1. Text Analysis:
   - Sentiment analysis of open responses
   - Key theme extraction
   - Behavioral pattern identification

2. Development Needs Identification:
   - Map gaps to learning interventions
   - Prioritize development areas
   - Generate recommendations

## 5. Output Generation

### Report Components
1. Individual Profile:
   - Current competency levels
   - Identified gaps
   - Development priorities

2. Learning Recommendations:
   - Specific training needs
   - Learning pathway suggestions
   - Priority areas for development

3. Organizational Insights:
   - Team-level gaps
   - Common development needs
   - Strategic training requirements

## 6. Continuous Improvement

### System Learning
1. Feedback Loop:
   - Collect user feedback
   - Track question effectiveness
   - Monitor response patterns

2. Algorithm Refinement:
   - Update matching criteria
   - Refine question generation
   - Improve scoring models

### Quality Assurance
1. Regular Validation:
   - Review matching accuracy
   - Assess question relevance
   - Update content based on NOS changes
