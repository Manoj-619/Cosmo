# Process Flow for Analyzing Job Descriptions and Mapping to Assessment Components

Create a detailed process flow for analyzing job descriptions and mapping them to various assessment components. Let me break this down systematically.

## Let me explain each component of this process flow:

### 1. Initial Job Description Analysis:
- Extract technical elements from the JD
- Categorize into skills, tools, and domain knowledge
- Determine required proficiency levels

### 2. NOS (National Occupational Standards) Mapping:
- Match identified skills to performance criteria
- Align knowledge requirements with knowledge criteria
- Assign appropriate NOS codes

### 3. Bloom's Taxonomy Integration:
- Analyze requirements across all six levels
- Each level informs different types of assessment questions:
  - Remember/Understand: Knowledge-based questions
  - Apply/Analyze: Technical skill assessment
  - Evaluate/Create: Behavioral and problem-solving scenarios

### 4. Assessment Question Development:
- Technical questions to verify hands-on skills
- Knowledge questions to assess theoretical understanding
- Behavioral questions to evaluate workplace competencies

### 5. Development Planning:
- Conduct gap analysis based on assessment results
- Create targeted development plans
- Track progress against NOS requirements
