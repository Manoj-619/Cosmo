### **Implementation Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Data Preparation**
1. **Ingest NOS Data**:
   - Extract and structure data from NOS documents relevant to the Sales role.
   - Store the competencies and criteria in a searchable database (e.g., Pinecone).

2. **Ingest Ofqual Data**:
   - Parse and organize Ofqual documents (Levels 1–7) for the Sales domain.
   - Focus on assessment units and criteria.
   - Store this data in the same or a compatible system for cross-referencing.

#### **Phase 2: Role-Based NOS Matching**
3. **Extract Key Terms from the Job Description (JD)**:
   - Identify relevant keywords or phrases from the learner’s job description (JD) or current role.
   - Use these terms to query and match the most relevant NOS document(s).

4. **Generate a List of NOS Competencies**:
   - Extract competencies from the matched NOS document(s).
   - Create a comprehensive list that aligns with the learner's role.

#### **Phase 3: Skills Assessment Framework**
5. **Gather Current Skills**:
   - Collect the learner’s self-reported skills or competencies.
   - For each reported skill:
     1. **Find Matching NOS Competencies**:
        - Match the skill to the most relevant competency from the NOS list.
     2. **Design Assessment Criteria**:
        - Use the matched NOS competency as the base.
        - Map the competency to Ofqual standards at the appropriate level.
        - Develop assessment criteria aligned with Bloom’s Taxonomy levels:
          - Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create.

#### **Phase 4: Learner Assessment**
6. **Conduct Targeted Assessment**:
   - **Narrow Down Criteria**:
     - Due to the large number of NOS and Ofqual criteria, narrow the focus:
       - Use only the criteria aligned with the learner’s current skills and role.
       - Ensure the assessment is targeted and feasible to avoid overwhelming the learner.
   - Assess the learner for each reported skill using the designed criteria.
   - Evaluate performance across Bloom’s levels for each competency.

7. **Identify Unassessed Competencies**:
   - Highlight competencies from the NOS list that were not covered in the assessment due to the absence of corresponding reported skills.

---

#### **Phase 5: Gap Analysis**
8. **Analyze Gaps in Competencies**:
   - For **assessed competencies**:
     - Compare the learner’s performance to the required NOS levels.
     - Determine the levels achieved and the gaps in Bloom’s Taxonomy criteria.
   - For **unassessed competencies**:
     - Mark these as completely unmet, requiring full attention in the learning process.

#### **Phase 6: Curriculum Design**
9. **Develop a Learning Pathway**:
   - Prioritize the curriculum design in two stages:
     1. **Stage 1: Assessed Competencies**:
        - Focus on closing gaps identified in the assessment.
        - Tailor learning materials to help the learner achieve the required levels for each competency.
     2. **Stage 2: Unassessed Competencies**:
        - Design training modules to introduce and develop entirely unassessed competencies.

10. **Iterative Learning and Assessment**:
    - Reassess the learner periodically to ensure progress towards meeting all NOS criteria.

### **Summary Workflow**
1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Import NOS and Ofqual standards.
2. **Role Matching**:
   - Extract key terms from the learner’s JD and match relevant NOS.
3. **Skills Mapping**:
   - Match reported skills to NOS competencies and design Bloom’s Taxonomy-based assessment criteria using Ofqual standards.
4. **Targeted Learner Assessment**:
   - Focus assessments on criteria aligned with the learner’s skills and role.
   - Avoid overloading the learner while ensuring relevant NOS and Ofqual criteria are covered.
5. **Gap Analysis**:
   - Highlight gaps in both assessed and unassessed NOS competencies.
6. **Curriculum Design**:
   - Develop a learning plan focusing on closing gaps in assessed and unassessed competencies.
