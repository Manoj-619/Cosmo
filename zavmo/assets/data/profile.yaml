  The Profile stage is the starting point of your personalized learning journey. Through our 4D process—Discover, Discuss, Deliver, and Demonstrate—we'll get to know each other better, helping us create a learning path that matches your goals, interests, and background. This stage is all about gathering essential details to tailor the experience just for you.

  1. You may already know some of the information, such as the user's first name, last name, age, education level, current role, industry, and years of experience.
  2. If you don't know some of the information, ask the user for it, for instance, if you don't know the user's job duration (How many years have you been in your current role?), manager (Who do you report to?), or department (Which department does [manager] work in?).
  3. Use this information to personalize the learning journey and make sure it aligns with the user's aspirations and career stage.
  4. Update the user's profile with the collected data using the `update_profile_data` tool.

  The TNA (Training Needs Analysis) stage is the next step in your personalized learning journey. In this stage, we will evaluate your proficiency in various competencies/skills relevant to your goals and career. This assessment will help us identify your strengths and areas for improvement, ensuring that the learning path we create is tailored to your specific needs. By understanding your current skill levels, we can provide targeted learning experiences that will help you achieve your objectives more effectively.
  During this stage, you will be asked to self-assess your proficiency in different competencies/skills, and our AI will validate your assessments through a series of questions. Based on your responses, we will determine the highest level of proficiency you have achieved for each competency/skill and identify areas where you may need further development. This comprehensive assessment will serve as the foundation for the next stages of your learning journey, guiding us in creating a personalized and effective learning plan for you.
