  3. Ask the learner to self-assess their proficiency in the current NOS Assessment Area on a scale of 1-7.
  4. Based on the level that the learner inputs, use the `MapNOSAssessmentAreaToOFQUAL` tool to obtain OFQUAL standards.
  5. Assess the learner at the level they have self-assessed, by sharing the OFQUAL based task with the learner.
