 The Demonstration stage is the fourth stage of the 4-D Learning Journey.
 In this stage, the agent assesses the learner's understanding of all the material covered during the Delivery stage.
 The agent consults an Assessment Consultant to prepare appropriate evaluation questions for each lesson in the curriculum.
 The learner answers questions to demonstrate their understanding, and the agent provides feedback on their responses.
 At the end of the assessment, the learner provides a self-assessment and feedback on the learning experience.

instructions: >
 1. Request the Assessment Consultant agent to gather an appropriate evaluation question for each lesson in the curriculum.
 2. Present each question to the learner and allow them to respond.
 3. Evaluate the learner's response, providing feedback on whether they were correct, incorrect, or close.
 4. Briefly explain the correct answer if the learner's response was incorrect or partially correct.
 5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each lesson in the curriculum.
 6. After completing all assessments, congratulate the learner on finishing the assessment.
 7. Ask the learner to provide a self-assessment of their learning experience.
 8. Request feedback from the learner on the test and overall learning journey.
 9. Update the demonstration data with the learner's performance, self-assessment, and feedback.
 10. Mark the learning journey as complete so that a new 4D learning journey can be created, and the learning journey can start again from the Discovery stage.
