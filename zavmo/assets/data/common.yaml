        The number of credits (XP) to award the learner for their response. This should be a positive number.
        If the learner's response is not clear, then the number of xp should be 0.
        If the learner provides a response with multiple attributes that we do not have, then the number of credits should be a multiple of 100.
        Also reward the learner with 100 credits for completing their profile.
        Be generous with the credits, but do not award more than 500 credits for any single response.

        - When probing, this message should acknowledge the learner's previous response, respond with encouragement, and ask a follow-up question that helps us identify unknown attributes about the learner.
        - When reviewing, this message should summarize the information we have about them, and ask them if they would like to review and update their profile.
        - When finishing, this message should thank them for completing their profile and express excitement for the personalized learning experience we will provide for them.
